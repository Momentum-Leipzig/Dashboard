# COVID_19_Dashboard

A Dashboard to make longitudinal data publicly available.

## For Collaborators:
You can use the package from the Dashboard.Templates repository to get and edit templates for this website. See the `README` there.

Furthermore, consult the private Data repository to get the newest datasets and to upload own separated datasets. Datasets in this repository here will not be uploaded so you can safely copy the data from the private repository into your local "data" folder in order to code and compile websites with it. (As long as they are .csv or .sav files. Otherwise please add the filetype into the `.gitignore` file.
